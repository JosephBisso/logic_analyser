# Logic Analyser

A FPGA hardware project for analyzing digital signals on the Xilinx FPGA Development board, developed as part of a university practical course.
<br>*Software used: Vivado*

## Features

- Captures and visualizes digital logic signals
- **8 channels**
- For signals of up to **1Mhz** frequency
- **VGA output**
- **Modular hardware design**

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code and firmware
- `img/` - Project images and diagrams

## Preview

The preview below demonstrates the logic analyser capturing a binary counting sequence across multiple channels. Each channel displays the corresponding digital waveform, illustrating the device's ability to accurately sample and visualize synchronous signal transitions in real time.<br>
